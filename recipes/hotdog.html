    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An archetypal food for those Filipino who cannot really cookâ€”kind of. This
      food can be enjoyed by people of all ages. That's basically a good
      empirical measure how good it is <strong>*wink wink*</strong>. Partnered
      with rice, banana ketchup, and some phantom nutritional values, this
      becomes a daily meal for lower to lower-middle class.
      <strong>*Sad reality intensifies.*</strong>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Purefoods Tender Juicy Hotdogs</li>
      <li>
        That 20 cents cooking oil with no brand. Just a clear recycled gin
        <em>bilog</em> bottle stuffed with cooking oil that comes from I do not
        know where. (Does it even pass health safety protocols whatsoever?)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>De-fucking-frost. Please.</li>
      <li>Measure the amount of oil with your guts.</li>
      <li>
        Pre-heat the cooking oil with whatever temperature. Just don't forgetti
        to sprinkle some water to check if it explodes already.
      </li>
      <li>During pre-heating, put some slits on the sides of each hotdogs.</li>
      <li>
        If the oil is hot enough, cook the hotdogs until the insides are golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>Server hot with banana ketchup or Mang Tomas sauce.</li>
    </ol>
